# samknows-router
This project is the result of a community effort made in collaboration with [ilpuntotecnico.com](https://www.ilpuntotecnico.com/forum/index.php)'s users. It aims to unlock the full potential of Samknows' Whitebox V3, that is a TP-LINK WDR3600 running a customized version of OpenWrt but with many features stripped down (such as SSH, routing and ability to install packages), as it's originally meant to be a network probe sent to volunteers for free.  
Compared to other similar projects, `samknows-router` doesn't selfishly replace SamKnows' custom OpenWrt with a vanilla build of it but instead it integrates it, allowing users to keep partecipating to network analysis while using the device as they wish.
